.SH NAME
apt-get \- APT package handling utility -- command-line interface
.SH SYNOPSIS

\fBapt-get\fR [ \fB-hvs\fR ] [ \fB-o=\fIconfig string\fB\fR ] [ \fB-c=\fIfile\fB\fR ] { \fBupdate\fR | \fBupgrade\fR | \fBinstall  \fIpkg\fB\fI ...\fB\fR | \fBremove  \fIpkg\fB\fI ...\fB\fR | \fBsource  \fIpkg\fB\fI ...\fB\fR | \fBbuild-dep  \fIpkg\fB\fI ...\fB\fR | \fBcheck\fR | \fBclean\fR | \fBautoclean\fR }

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
\fBapt-get\fR is the command-line tool for handling packages, and may be 
considered the user's "back-end" to other tools using the APT
library.  Several "front-end" interfaces exist, such as synaptic and
aptitude.
.PP
Unless the \fB-h\fR, or \fB--help\fR option is given, one of the
commands below must be present.
.TP
\fBupdate\fR
update is used to resynchronize the package index files from
their sources. The indexes of available packages are fetched from the
location(s) specified in \fI/etc/apt/sources.list\fR\&.
An update should always be 
performed before an upgrade or dist-upgrade\&.
.TP
\fBupgrade\fR
upgrade is used to install the newest versions of all packages 
currently installed on the system from the sources enumerated in
\fI/etc/apt/sources.list\fR\&. Packages currently installed with 
new versions available are retrieved and upgraded; under no circumstances 
are currently installed packages removed, or packages not already installed 
retrieved and installed. New versions of currently installed packages that 
cannot be upgraded without changing the install status of another package 
will be left at their current version. An update must be 
performed first so that \fBapt-get\fR knows that new versions of packages are 
available.
.TP
\fBdist-upgrade\fR
dist-upgrade, in addition to performing the function of 
upgrade, also intelligently handles changing dependencies 
with new versions of packages; \fBapt-get\fR has a "smart" conflict 
resolution system, and it will attempt to upgrade the most important 
packages at the expense of less important ones if necessary. 
The \fI/etc/apt/sources.list\fR file contains a list of locations 
from which to retrieve desired package files.
See also \fBapt_preferences\fR(5) for a mechanism for
overriding the general settings for individual packages.
.TP
\fBinstall\fR
install is followed by one or more packages desired for 
installation. Each package is a package name, not a fully qualified 
filename (for instance, in a Fedora Core system, glibc would be the 
argument provided, not glibc-2.4.8.i686.rpm). 
All packages required 
by the package(s) specified for installation will also be retrieved and 
installed. The \fI/etc/apt/sources.list\fR file is used to locate 
the desired packages. If a hyphen is appended to the package name (with 
no intervening space), the identified package will be removed if it is 
installed. Similarly a plus sign can be used to designate a package to 
install. These latter features may be used to override decisions made by 
apt-get's conflict resolution system.

A specific version of a package can be selected for installation by 
following the package name with an equals and the version of the package 
to select. This will cause that version to be located and selected for
install. Alternatively a specific distribution can be selected by 
following the package name with a slash and the version of the 
distribution or the Archive name (stable, testing, unstable).

Both of the version selection mechanisms can downgrade packages and must
be used with care.

Finally, the \fBapt_preferences\fR(5) mechanism allows you to
create an alternative installation policy for
individual packages.

If no package matches the given expression and the expression contains one
of '.', '?' or '*' then it is assumed to be a POSIX regular expression,
and it is applied
to all package names in the database. Any matches are then installed (or
removed). Note that matching is done by substring so 'lo.*' matches 'how-lo'
and 'lowest'. If this is undesired, anchor the regular expression
with a '^' or '$' character, or create a more specific regular expression.
.TP
\fBremove\fR
remove is identical to install except that packages are 
removed instead of installed. If a plus sign is appended to the package 
name (with no intervening space), the identified package will be 
installed instead of removed.
.TP
\fBsource\fR
source causes \fBapt-get\fR to fetch source packages. APT 
will examine the available packages to decide which source package to 
fetch. It will then find and download into the current directory the 
newest available version of that source package. Source packages are 
tracked separately from binary packages via rpm-src type lines 
in the \fB\fIsources.list\fB\fR(5) file. This probably will mean that you will not 
get the same source as the package you have installed or as you could 
install. If the --compile options is specified then the package will be 
compiled to a binary using rpmbuild, if --download-only is 
specified then the source package will not be unpacked.

A specific source version can be retrieved by postfixing the source name
with an equals and then the version to fetch, similar to the mechanism
used for the package files. This enables exact matching of the source 
package name and version, implicitly enabling the 
APT::Get::Only-Source option.

Note that source packages are not tracked like binary packages, they 
exist only in the current directory and are similar to downloading source
tar balls.
.TP
\fBbuild-dep\fR
build-dep causes apt-get to install/remove packages in an 
attempt to satisfy the build dependencies for a source package.
.TP
\fBcheck\fR
check is a diagnostic tool; it updates the package cache and checks 
for broken dependencies.
.TP
\fBclean\fR
clean clears out the local repository of retrieved package 
files. It removes everything but the lock file from 
\fI/var/cache/apt/archives/\fR and 
\fI/var/cache/apt/archives/partial/\fR\&. 
.TP
\fBautoclean\fR
Like clean, autoclean clears out the local 
repository of retrieved package files. The difference is that it only 
removes package files that can no longer be downloaded, and are largely 
useless. This allows a cache to be maintained over a long period without 
it growing out of control. The configuration option 
APT::Clean-Installed will prevent installed packages from being
erased if it is set to off.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.PP
All command line options may be set using the configuration file, the
descriptions indicate the configuration option to set. For boolean
options you can override the config file by using something like 
\fB-f-\fR,\fB--no-f\fR, \fB-f=no\fR or several other variations.
.TP
\fB-d\fR
.TP
\fB--download-only\fR
Download only; package files are only retrieved, not unpacked or installed.
Configuration Item: APT::Get::Download-Only\&.
.TP
\fB-f\fR
.TP
\fB--fix-broken\fR
Fix; attempt to correct a system with broken dependencies in            
place. This option, when used with install/remove, can omit any packages
to permit APT to deduce a likely solution. Any Package that are specified
must completely correct the problem. The option is sometimes necessary when 
running APT for the first time; APT itself does not allow broken package 
dependencies to exist on a system. It is possible that a system's 
dependency structure can be so corrupt as to require manual intervention 
Use of this option together with \fB-m\fR may produce an
error in some situations. 
Configuration Item: APT::Get::Fix-Broken\&.
.TP
\fB-m\fR
.TP
\fB--ignore-missing\fR
.TP
\fB--fix-missing\fR
Ignore missing packages; If packages cannot be retrieved or fail the    
integrity check after retrieval (corrupted package files), hold back    
those packages and handle the result. Use of this option together with  
\fB-f\fR may produce an error in some situations. If a package is 
selected for installation (particularly if it is mentioned on the 
command line) and it could not be downloaded then it will be silently 
held back.
Configuration Item: APT::Get::Fix-Missing\&.
.TP
\fB--no-download\fR
Disables downloading of packages. This is best used with 
\fB--ignore-missing\fR to force APT to use only the .rpms it has 
already downloaded.
Configuration Item: APT::Get::Download\&.
.TP
\fB-q\fR
.TP
\fB--quiet\fR
Quiet; produces output suitable for logging, omitting progress indicators.
More q's will produce more quiet up to a maximum of 2. You can also use
\fB-q=#\fR to set the quiet level, overriding the configuration file. 
Note that quiet level 2 implies \fB-y\fR, you should never use -qq 
without a no-action modifier such as -d, --print-uris or -s as APT may 
decided to do something you did not expect.
Configuration Item: quiet\&.
.TP
\fB-s\fR
.TP
\fB--simulate\fR
.TP
\fB--just-print\fR
.TP
\fB--dry-run\fR
.TP
\fB--recon\fR
.TP
\fB--no-act\fR
No action; perform a simulation of events that would occur but do not
actually change the system. 
Configuration Item: APT::Get::Simulate\&.

Simulate prints out
a series of lines each one representing an rpm operation, Configure (Conf),
Remove (Remv), Unpack (Inst). Square brackets indicate broken packages with
and empty set of square brackets meaning breaks that are of no consequence
(rare).
.TP
\fB-y\fR
.TP
\fB--yes\fR
.TP
\fB--assume-yes\fR
Automatic yes to prompts; assume "yes" as answer to all prompts and run
non-interactively. If an undesirable situation, such as changing a held
package or removing an essential package occurs then apt-get 
will abort. 
Configuration Item: APT::Get::Assume-Yes\&.
.TP
\fB-u\fR
.TP
\fB--show-upgraded\fR
Show upgraded packages; Print out a list of all packages that are to be
upgraded. 
Configuration Item: APT::Get::Show-Upgraded\&.
.TP
\fB-V\fR
.TP
\fB--verbose-versions\fR
Show full versions for upgraded and installed packages.
Configuration Item: APT::Get::Show-Versions\&.
.TP
\fB-b\fR
.TP
\fB--compile\fR
.TP
\fB--build\fR
Compile source packages after downloading them.
Configuration Item: APT::Get::Compile\&.
.TP
\fB--ignore-hold\fR
Ignore package Holds; This causes \fBapt-get\fR to ignore a hold 
placed on a package. This may be useful in conjunction with 
dist-upgrade to override a large number of undesired holds. 
Configuration Item: APT::Ignore-Hold\&.
.TP
\fB--no-upgrade\fR
Do not upgrade packages; When used in conjunction with install
no-upgrade will prevent packages listed from being upgraded
if they are already installed. 
Configuration Item: APT::Get::Upgrade\&.
.TP
\fB--force-yes\fR
Force yes; This is a dangerous option that will cause apt to continue 
without prompting if it is doing something potentially harmful. It 
should not be used except in very special situations. Using 
force-yes can potentially destroy your system! 
Configuration Item: APT::Get::force-yes\&.
.TP
\fB--print-uris\fR
Instead of fetching the files to install their URIs are printed. Each
URI will have the path, the destination file name, the size and the expected
md5 hash. Note that the file name to write to will not always match
the file name on the remote site! This also works with the 
source and update commands. When used with the
update command the MD5 and size are not included, and it is
up to the user to decompress any compressed files.
Configuration Item: APT::Get::Print-URIs\&.
.TP
\fB--purge\fR
Use purge instead of remove for anything that would be removed.
An asterisk ("*") will be displayed next to packages which are
scheduled to be purged.
Configuration Item: APT::Get::Purge\&.
.TP
\fB--reinstall\fR
Re-Install packages that are already installed and at the newest version.
Configuration Item: APT::Get::ReInstall\&.
.TP
\fB--list-cleanup\fR
This option defaults to on, use --no-list-cleanup to turn it 
off. When on \fBapt-get\fR will automatically manage the contents of 
\fI/var/lib/apt/lists\fR to ensure that obsolete files are erased. 
The only  reason to turn it off is if you frequently change your source 
list. 
Configuration Item: APT::Get::List-Cleanup\&.
.TP
\fB-t\fR
.TP
\fB--target-release\fR
.TP
\fB--default-release\fR
This option controls the default input to the policy engine, it creates
a default pin at priority 990 using the specified release string. The
preferences file may further override this setting. In short, this option
lets you have simple control over which distribution packages will be
retrieved from. Some common examples might be 
\fB-t '2.1*'\fR or \fB-t unstable\fR\&.
Configuration Item: APT::Default-Release;
see also the \fBapt_preferences\fR(5) manual page.
.TP
\fB--trivial-only\fR
Only perform operations that are 'trivial'. Logically this can be considered
related to \fB--assume-yes\fR, where \fB--assume-yes\fR will answer 
yes to any prompt, \fB--trivial-only\fR will answer no. 
Configuration Item: APT::Get::Trivial-Only\&.
.TP
\fB--no-remove\fR
If any packages are to be removed apt-get immediately aborts without
prompting. 
Configuration Item: APT::Get::Remove
.TP
\fB--only-source\fR
Only has meaning for the source command.  Indicates that the
given source names are not to be mapped through the binary
table.  This means that if this option is specified, the
source command will only accept source package names as
arguments, rather than accepting binary package names and looking
up the corresponding source package.
Configuration Item: APT::Get::Only-Source
.TP
\fB--diff-only\fR
.TP
\fB--tar-only\fR
Download only the diff or tar file of a source archive. 
Configuration Item: APT::Get::Diff-Only and 
APT::Get::Tar-Only
.TP
\fB--arch-only\fR
Only process architecture-dependent build-dependencies.
Configuration Item: APT::Get::Arch-Only 
.TP
\fB-h\fR
.TP
\fB--help\fR
Show a short usage summary.
.TP
\fB-v\fR
.TP
\fB--version\fR
Show the program version.
.TP
\fB-c\fR
.TP
\fB--config-file\fR
Configuration File; Specify a configuration file to use. 
The program will read the default configuration file and then this 
configuration file. See \fB\fIapt.conf\fB\fR(5) for syntax information.     
.TP
\fB-o\fR
.TP
\fB--option\fR
Set a Configuration Option; This will set an arbitrary configuration 
option. The syntax is \fB-o Foo::Bar=bar\fR\&.
