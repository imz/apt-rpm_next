.SH NAME
apt-cache \- APT package handling utility -- cache manipulator
.SH SYNOPSIS

\fBapt-cache\fR [ \fB-hvsn\fR ] [ \fB-o=\fIconfig string\fB\fR ] [ \fB-c=\fIfile\fB\fR ] { \fBadd  \fIfile\fB\fI ...\fB\fR | \fBgencaches\fR | \fBshowpkg  \fIpkg\fB\fI ...\fB\fR | \fBshowsrc  \fIpkg\fB\fI ...\fB\fR | \fBstats\fR | \fBdump\fR | \fBdumpavail\fR | \fBunmet\fR | \fBsearch  \fIregex\fB\fR | \fBshow  \fIpkg\fB\fI ...\fB\fR | \fBdepends  \fIpkg\fB\fI ...\fB\fR | \fBwhatdepends  \fIpkg\fB\fI ...\fB\fR | \fBpkgnames  \fIprefix\fB\fR | \fBdotty  \fIpkg\fB\fI ...\fB\fR | \fBpolicy  \fIpkgs\fB\fI ...\fB\fR }

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
\fBapt-cache\fR performs a variety of operations on APT's package 
cache. \fBapt-cache\fR does not manipulate the state of the system 
but does provide operations to search and generate interesting output 
from the package metadata.
.PP
Unless the \fB-h\fR, or \fB--help\fR option is given, one of the
commands below must be present.
.TP
\fBadd \fIfile(s)\fB\fR
add adds the named package index files to the package cache.
This is for debugging only.
.TP
\fBgencaches\fR
gencaches performs the same operation as 
\fBapt-get check\fR\&. It builds the source and package caches from 
the sources in \fB\fIsources.list\fB\fR(5) and from \fI/var/lib/rpm/\fR\&.
.TP
\fBshowpkg \fIpkg(s)\fB\fR
showpkg displays information about the packages listed on the 
command line. Remaining arguments are package names. The available 
versions and reverse dependencies of each package listed are listed, as 
well as forward dependencies for each version. Forward (normal) 
dependencies are those packages upon which the package in question 
depends; reverse dependencies are those packages that depend upon the 
package in question. Thus, forward dependencies must be satisfied for a 
package, but reverse dependencies need not be.
For instance, \fBapt-cache showpkg libreadline2\fR would produce 
output similar to the following:


.nf
Package: libreadline2
Versions: 2.1-12(/var/lib/apt/lists/foo_Packages),
Reverse Depends: 
  libreadlineg2,libreadline2
  libreadline2-altdev,libreadline2
Dependencies:
2.1-12 - libc5 (2 5.4.0-0) ncurses3.0 (0 (null))
Provides:
2.1-12 - 
Reverse Provides: 
.fi

Thus it may be seen that libreadline2, version 2.1-12, depends on libc5 and
ncurses3.0 which must be installed for libreadline2 to work. 
In turn, libreadlineg2 and libreadline2-altdev depend on libreadline2. If
libreadline2 is installed, libc5 and ncurses3.0 (and ldso) must also be
installed; libreadlineg2 and libreadline2-altdev do not have to be
installed. For the specific meaning of the remainder of the output it
is best to consult the apt source code.
.TP
\fBstats\fR
stats displays some statistics about the cache.
No further arguments are expected. Statistics reported are:
.RS
.TP 0.2i
\(bu
Total package names is the number of package names found 
in the cache.
.TP 0.2i
\(bu
Normal packages is the number of regular, ordinary package 
names; these are packages that bear a one-to-one correspondence between 
their names and the names used by other packages for them in 
dependencies. The majority of packages fall into this category.
.TP 0.2i
\(bu
Pure virtual packages is the number of packages that exist 
only as a virtual package name; that is, packages only "provide" the 
virtual package name, and no package actually uses the name. For 
instance, "mail-transport-agent" in the Debian GNU/Linux system is a 
pure virtual package; several packages provide "mail-transport-agent", 
but there is no package named "mail-transport-agent".
.TP 0.2i
\(bu
Single virtual packages is the number of packages with only 
one package providing a particular virtual package. For example, in the
Debian GNU/Linux system, "X11-text-viewer" is a virtual package, but 
only one package, xless, provides "X11-text-viewer".
.TP 0.2i
\(bu
Mixed virtual packages is the number of packages that either 
provide a particular virtual package or have the virtual package name 
as the package name. For instance, in the Debian GNU/Linux system, 
"debconf" is both an actual package, and provided by the debconf-tiny
package.
.TP 0.2i
\(bu
Missing is the number of package names that were referenced in
a dependency but were not provided by any package. Missing packages may 
be in evidence if a full distribution is not accessed, or if a package
(real or virtual) has been dropped from the distribution. Usually they
are referenced from Conflicts statements.
.TP 0.2i
\(bu
Total distinct versions is the number of package versions 
found in the cache; this value is therefore at least equal to the 
number of total package names. If more than one distribution (both 
"stable" and "unstable", for instance), is being accessed, this value 
can be considerably larger than the number of total package names.
.TP 0.2i
\(bu
Total dependencies is the number of dependency relationships 
claimed by all of the packages in the cache.
.RE
.TP
\fBshowsrc \fIpkg(s)\fB\fR
showsrc displays all the source package records that match
the given package names. All versions are shown, as well as all 
records that declare the name to be a Binary.
.TP
\fBdump\fR
dump shows a short listing of every package in the cache. It is 
primarily for debugging.
.TP
\fBdumpavail\fR
dumpavail prints out an available list to stdout.
.TP
\fBunmet\fR
unmet displays a summary of all unmet dependencies in the 
package cache.
.TP
\fBshow \fIpkg(s)\fB\fR
Displays the package records for the named packages.
.TP
\fBsearch \fIregex [ regex ... ]\fB\fR
search performs a full text search on all available package
lists for the regex pattern given. It searches the package names and the
descriptions for an occurrence of the regular expression and prints out
the package name and the short description. If \fB--full\fR is given
then output identical to show is produced for each matched
package, and if \fB--names-only\fR is given then the long description
is not searched, only the package name is.

Separate arguments can be used to specify multiple search patterns that 
are and'ed together.
.TP
\fBdepends \fIpkg(s)\fB\fR
depends shows a listing of each dependency a package has 
and all the possible other packages that can fulfill that dependency.
.TP
\fBwhatdepends \fIpkg(s)\fB\fR
whatdepends shows a listing of what depends on a package.
.TP
\fBwhatprovides \fIpkg(s)\fB\fR
whatprovides shows a listing of package which provides a
dependency.
.TP
\fBpkgnames \fI[ prefix ]\fB\fR
This command prints the name of each package in the system. The optional
argument is a prefix match to filter the name list. The output is suitable
for use in a shell tab complete function and the output is generated 
extremely quickly. This command is best used with the 
\fB--generate\fR option.
.TP
\fBdotty \fIpkg(s)\fB\fR
dotty takes a list of packages on the command line and 
generates output suitable for use by dotty from the 
GraphViz <URL:http://www.research.att.com/sw/tools/graphviz/>
package. The result will be a set of nodes and edges representing the 
relationships between the packages. By default the given packages will 
trace out all dependent packages; this can produce a very large graph. 
To limit the output to only the packages listed on the command line,
set the APT::Cache::GivenOnly option.

The resulting nodes will have several shapes; normal packages are boxes,
pure provides are triangles, mixed provides are diamonds, 
missing packages are hexagons. Orange boxes mean recursion was stopped 
[leaf packages], blue lines are pre-depends, green lines are conflicts.

Caution, dotty cannot graph larger sets of packages.
.TP
\fBpolicy \fI[ pkg(s) ]\fB\fR
policy is ment to help debug issues relating to the 
preferences file. With no arguments it will print out the 
priorities of each source. Otherwise it prints out detailed information
about the priority selection of the named package.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.PP
All command line options may be set using the configuration file, the
descriptions indicate the configuration option to set. For boolean
options you can override the config file by using something like 
\fB-f-\fR,\fB--no-f\fR, \fB-f=no\fR or several other variations.
.TP
\fB-p\fR
.TP
\fB--pkg-cache\fR
Select the file to store the package cache. The package cache is the 
primary cache used by all operations.
Configuration Item: Dir::Cache::pkgcache\&.
.TP
\fB-s\fR
.TP
\fB--src-cache\fR
Select the file to store the source cache. The source is used only by
gencaches and it stores a parsed version of the package 
information from remote sources. When building the package cache the 
source cache is used to advoid reparsing all of the package files.
Configuration Item: Dir::Cache::srcpkgcache\&.
.TP
\fB-q\fR
.TP
\fB--quiet\fR
Quiet; produces output suitable for logging, omitting progress indicators.
More q's will produce more quietness up to a maximum of 2. You can also use
\fB-q=#\fR to set the quietness level, overriding the configuration file.
Configuration Item: quiet\&.
.TP
\fB-i\fR
.TP
\fB--important\fR
Print only important dependencies; for use with unmet. Causes only Depends and 
Pre-Depends relations to be printed.
Configuration Item: APT::Cache::Important\&.
.TP

.TP
\fB--full\fR
Print full package records when searching. 
Configuration Item: APT::Cache::ShowFull\&.
.TP
\fB-a\fR
.TP
\fB--all-versions\fR
Print full records for all available versions. This is the
default; to turn it off, use \fB--no-all-versions\fR\&.
If \fB--no-all-versions\fR is specified, only the candidate version
will displayed (the one which would be selected for installation).
This option is only applicable to  the show command.
Configuration Item: APT::Cache::AllVersions\&.
.TP
\fB-g\fR
.TP
\fB--generate\fR
Perform automatic package cache regeneration, rather than use the cache 
as it is. This is the default; to turn it off, use \fB--no-generate\fR\&.
Configuration Item: APT::Cache::Generate\&.
.TP
\fB--names-only\fR
.TP
\fB-n\fR
Only search on the package names, not the long descriptions. 
Configuration Item: APT::Cache::NamesOnly\&.
.TP
\fB--all-names\fR
Make pkgnames print all names, including virtual packages 
and missing dependencies. 
Configuration Item: APT::Cache::AllNames\&.
.TP
\fB--recurse\fR
Make depends recursive so that all packages mentioned are 
printed once.
Configuration Item: APT::Cache::RecurseDepends\&.
