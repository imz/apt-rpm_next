.SH NAME
apt-cdrom \- APT CDROM management utility
.SH SYNOPSIS

\fBapt-cdrom\fR [ \fB-hvrmfan\fR ] [ \fB-d=\fIcdrom mount point\fB\fR ] [ \fB-o=\fIconfig string\fB\fR ] [ \fB-c=\fIfile\fB\fR ] { \fBadd\fR | \fBident\fR }

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
\fBapt-cdrom\fR is used to add a new CDROM to APTs list of available 
sources. \fBapt-cdrom\fR takes care of determining the structure of 
the disc as well as correcting for several possible mis-burns and 
verifying the index files.   
.PP
It is necessary to use \fBapt-cdrom\fR to add CDs to the APT system, 
it cannot be done by hand. Furthermore each disk in a multi-cd set must be
inserted and scanned separately to account for possible mis-burns.
.PP
Unless the \fB-h\fR, or \fB--help\fR option is given one of the
commands below must be present.
.TP
\fBadd\fR
add is used to add a new disc to the source list. It will unmount the
CDROM device, prompt for a disk to be inserted and then procceed to 
scan it and copy the index files. If the disc does not have a proper
\fI\&.disk/\fR directory you will be prompted for a descriptive 
title.

APT uses a CDROM ID to track which disc is currently in the drive and
maintains a database of these IDs in 
\fI/var/lib/apt/cdroms.list\fR
.TP
\fBident\fR
A debugging tool to report the identity of the current disc as well
as the stored file name
.SH "OPTIONS"
.PP
All command line options may be set using the configuration file, the
descriptions indicate the configuration option to set. For boolean
options you can override the config file by using something like 
\fB-f-\fR,\fB--no-f\fR, \fB-f=no\fR or several other variations.
.TP
\fB-d\fR
.TP
\fB--cdrom\fR
Mount point; specify the location to mount the cdrom. This mount 
point must be listed in \fI/etc/fstab\fR and properly configured.
Configuration Item: Acquire::cdrom::mount\&.
.TP
\fB-r\fR
.TP
\fB--rename\fR
Rename a disc; change the label of a disk or override the disks 
given label. This option will cause \fBapt-cdrom\fR to prompt for 
a new label.
Configuration Item: APT::CDROM::Rename\&.
.TP
\fB-m\fR
.TP
\fB--no-mount\fR

the mount point.
Configuration Item: APT::CDROM::NoMount\&.
.TP
\fB-f\fR
.TP
\fB--fast\fR
Fast Copy; Assume the package files are valid and do not check

\fBapt-cdrom\fR has been run on this disc before and did not detect 
any errors.
Configuration Item: APT::CDROM::Fast\&.
.TP
\fB-a\fR
.TP
\fB--thorough\fR
Thorough Package Scan; This option may be needed with some old

.TP
\fB--just-print\fR
.TP
\fB--recon\fR
