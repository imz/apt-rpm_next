.SH NAME
apt-config \- APT Configuration Query program
.SH SYNOPSIS

\fBapt-config\fR [ \fB-hv\fR ] [ \fB-o=\fIconfig string\fB\fR ] [ \fB-c=\fIfile\fB\fR ] { \fBshell\fR | \fBdump\fR }

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
\fBapt-config\fR is an internal program used by various portions of
the APT suite to provide consistent configurability. It accesses the main 
configuration file \fI/etc/apt/apt.conf\fR in a manner that is 
easy to use by scripted applications.
.PP
Unless the \fB-h\fR, or \fB--help\fR option is given one of the
commands below must be present.
.TP
\fBshell\fR
shell is used to access the configuration information from a shell 
script. It is given pairs of arguments, the first being a shell 
variable and the second the configuration value to query. As output 
it lists a series of shell assignments commands for each present value. 
In a shell script it should be used like:


.nf
OPTS="-f"
RES=`apt-config shell OPTS MyApp::Options`
eval $RES
.fi

This will set the shell environment variable $OPTS to the value of
MyApp::Options with a default of \fB-f\fR\&.

The configuration item may be postfixed with a /[fdbi]. f returns file
names, d returns directories, b returns true or false and i returns an 
integer. Each of the returns is normalized and verified internally.
.TP
\fBdump\fR
Just show the contents of the configuration space.
.SH "OPTIONS"

All command line options may be set using the configuration file, the
descriptions indicate the configuration option to set. For boolean
